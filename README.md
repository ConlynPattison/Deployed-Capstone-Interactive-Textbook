Linear algebra is a complicated subject and is essential to representing and manipulating geometry in virtual space. There is a lack of free, online software that allows students to interact with the applied concepts. This shortage of material is detrimental as the visual context of this math is crucial to its applications in computer graphics.

## Approach
Our approach encompassed the application development cycle, from its conception in early design phases, many rounds of feedback and refinement, to finally deploying our application. To create an inviting and consistent theme, we used Figma to make a design that utilized web typography, as well as visual mockups of our page layouts. Our plan to integrate simple lessons with dynamic content was to use React bootstrapped with Vite. This allows us to build our application and test it locally. The project was written 
in TypeScript to keep it tidy and well maintained. The online textbook covers explanations on topics that were requested by our supervisor, as well as developed animations and interactable activities through the use of the Three.js library. 

## Results
Successfully developed a React frontend application and deployed it on Vercel. The application includes:
- Written content covering basic linear algebra concepts
- Interactive elements for each concept
- User testing was conducted in the CSUMB Graphics Programming class, which provided a rich source of feedback and proved that our approach was very easy to understand as well as engaging.
